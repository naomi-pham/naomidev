        I began coding 2 years ago and have worked a React developer for over a
        year. It's been a great journey so far as I was exposed to various
        tools, frameworks, and processes to improve my coding skills and
        mindset. Moving forward, I hope to dedicate more time to building my own
        projects and writing about what I learn.
